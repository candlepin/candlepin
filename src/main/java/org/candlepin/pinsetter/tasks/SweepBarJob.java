/**
 * PinsetterSweepBarJob
 * en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinsetter
 * The Sweep Bar, or "rake", clears pins.
 * This job marks orphaned jobs as "canceled"
 *
 * An orphaned job is defined as a non-finished/failed/canceled
 * job status that does not correspond to a quartz job.
 *
 * This job does not need to run nearly as frequently as
 * the unpause job, because it should be very rare, if
 * not impossible in most cases for this state to be hit.
 *
 * This will most often occur when a clustered candlepin
 * is restarted, quartz jobs are volitile, and will be
 * removed, however cp_jobs (JobStatus) will not reflect
 * changes.
