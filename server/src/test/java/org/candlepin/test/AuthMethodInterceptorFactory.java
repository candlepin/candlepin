/**
 * This is a testing class that converts our AuthInterceptor into a Method interceptor
 * so that we can use it during testing without having to set up an entire RestEasy
 * environment.
 *
 * Since the AuthInterceptor class requires an Injector and method interceptors
 * are created in Guice modules, we encounter a problem.  It's not
 * really possible to grab your own injector within your module (see
 * http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15989991/accessing-guice-injector-in-its-module ).
 * So we have to use deferred binding via the requestInjection() method and this operates
 * on field injection.  Instead of messing with the internals of AuthInterceptor to
 * allow this, we have the AuthMethodInterceptorFactory class which creates the
 * AuthInterceptor at method invocation time after all our dependencies have been
 * injected.
