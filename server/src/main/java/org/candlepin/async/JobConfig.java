/**
 * The JobConfig object collects the configuration for a job, which can be provided to the
 * JobManager to queue a new instance of that job.
 * <p></p>
 * This class allows for a generic type definition, which subclasses should use to specify
 * the exact subclass or subclass type represents this class. This function is purely to
 * facilitate method chaining with mutators that return a self reference.
 *
 * For example, if we have a JobConfig subclass named TestJobConfig, it should be declared as
 * follows:
 *
 *      public TestJobConfig extends JobConfig<TestJobConfig>
 *
 * While redundant, this signals the specific JobConfig subclass to return by mutators implemented
 * by the base JobConfig class. Similarly, if the TestJobConfig was designed such that it is
 * intended to be further subclassed, it should be declared as follows:
 *
 *      public [abstract] TestJobConfig<T extends TestJobConfig> extends JobConfig<T>
 *
 * Mutators implemented in TestJobConfig then would have declarations as such:
 *
 *      public T setSomeValue(String value) {
 *          this.value = value; // Assign the value
 *
 *          return (T) this;
 *      }
 *
 * Subclasses would then follow one of these patterns as necessary according to their design and
 * intent.
 *
 * @param <T>
 *  the concrete JobConfig class being implemented
