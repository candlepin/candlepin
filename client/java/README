BUILD INFO:
----------
Install buildr(http://buildr.apache.org/) and then run
'buildr package' to generate the candlepin-client-*.jar within target/ 


SETUP INFO:
----------
The java client requires the following information to run properly,
 *) Candlepin server's URL:
    This is required to connect to the remote server.
    For example,
    	 https://example.com:8443/candlepin/
    default value is,
    	 https://localhost:8443/candlepin/
	 
 *) Directory location where the client will store entitlements and keys:
    This is the directory where the client will store the entitlements downloaded from
    the server as well as your identity certificate/keys.
    For example,
    	/home/user/.candlepin (or) C:/candlepin
    default value is,
    	  $HOME/.candlepin
	  
 *) KeyStore location:
    This is specific to Java. Java's SSL api requires a chain of trust managers
    so that it can validate the identity of the other party as well as store your
    local identity in the form of keys, certificates. For more information, please
    visit http://java.sun.com/javase/technologies/security/. KeyStore is a file which
    is stores your keys, certificates securely. Use 'keytool' utility to generate your keystore.
    Assuming your candlepin server runs on tomcat, you should have a certificate stored within
    this keystore with the alias 'tomcat'. The same applies for other setups.

    For example,
    	keystore could be present at any readable location: /home/jackie/tomcat6/conf/keystore
    default value is,
    	/usr/share/tomcat6/conf/keystore.

    IMPORTANT:
    ---------
    If you don't specify the right location, your client will not work. However, if you don't want to validate
    the identity of the server, you can run all the commands of the client with the '-k' or '--insecure' option.
    
    For example,
    	./client.sh register -u user -p pass -k
	./client.bat register -u user -p pass -k

    This will switch off java's check on remote server's identity and you can happily proceed consuming and
    subscribing to new products! 

PUTTING THE CONFIG TOGETHER:
---------------------------
All the above information should be specified in a proper java property file. The client by default, looks into
the location $HOME/.candlepin/candlepin.conf. So say, you are ready to run the client, then your candlepin.conf file
would look like the following.

#sample config only!
serverURL=https://example.com:8443/candlepin
candlePinHomeDirectory=/home/jackie/.candlepin
keyStoreLocation=/home/jackie/.candlepin/keystore


If you don't want to put the config file in $HOME/.candlepin/candlepin.conf, you can specify the location of the
config file to the client using the option

       ./client.sh --configLoc=/home/jackie/documents/candlepin.conf list -a
       
A sample config file is present in the same directory as this README file.
