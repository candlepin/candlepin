 * in the real application because RestEasy uses IsHttpMethod to pick up the
 * ResourceMethods that it will handle.  However, we need this matcher for testing
 * because we test with a AOP method interceptor which we don't want to apply
 * to just plain public/protected methods.  Also note that this matcher runs
 * on application deployment and not on every request.
