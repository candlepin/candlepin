=== Configuring a build system ===
You may want to use a build system such as [http://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/
koji], you can configure {{{tito}}} to
use submit builds to it.

Add your build system name as a section and define the tags you want to build.

{{{
[koji]
autobuild_tags = dist-f13-updates-candidate
}}}

Now configure any rpm macros you need configured for the specific tags by using
the tags as the
section name:

{{{
[dist-f13-updates-candidate]
disttag = .fc13
...
}}}



== Releasing with tito ==

Once you are ready to release Candlepin, first thing you need to do is tag the
build.

{{{
tito tag
}}}

Tito will bring up {{{$EDITOR}}} with the auto-generated changelog entries.
'''Verify'''
they look sane, feel free to edit them if necessary. Once they're ready, save
the file.

Tito will then give you the next steps:

{{{
Tagging new version of candlepin: 0.0.40-1 -> 0.0.41-1

Created tag: candlepin-0.0.41-1
View: git show HEAD
Undo: tito tag -u
Push: git push && git push --tags
}}}

'''IMPORTANT''': Do not run rebase after tagging a package. If someone
commits to master before you can push out your tag, you must either use
{{{git pull}}} (without {{{--rebase}}}) and accept the merge commit
that will be generated, or throw away your local changes, delete the tag
locally, and start again. If you do a rebase, your commit ID will change (as it
has been re-applied on top of the working tree) while your tag now points to a
non-existent commit. If this happens the tag will not be buildable and package
will need to be tagged again. (not the end of the world)
